# dotfiles
Partial selection of dotfiles. They are currated (personal and silly stuff left out).

## Structure
Intended preliminary structure (may change if it is to hard to manage):

Each computer and OS combination have its own branch.

This is due to differences in hardware and package availability. 

The end goal is to have a basic setup which works accross every setup and this drives the selection of used applications.

As an example [IceWM](https://ice-wm.org/) was replaced with [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page) because Openbox is the same version in all reporsitories.


## Origin
The base is stolen from [crunchbangplusplus](https://github.com/CBPP/cbpp-configs) config files. It is not a fork, because it is not intended to live in the same envoirement.

## Master branch
Will be somewhat of a empty shell which new branches are based upon. It will likely be the bare minimum of configs that is common among each branch and might grow stale quickly as changhes in branches are not merged.
